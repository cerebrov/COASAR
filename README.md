# Coasar
- Our simple hackathon project created to prepare the basis for our machine learning integrations.
- Cerebro provides information on refugees using various data. While presenting this information, various display methods were used by classifying data according to their types.

# Technical Solution Details
### http://cerebrov/coasar/github.io
Refugee capacity, circulation and asylum are the 3 core issues of the cerebro team. We have created an existing refugee map to analyze statistical data such as the current refugee capacity of the countries, the regular and irregular migration of refugees and the distribution of these migrations by population.While doing the refugee analysis, we performed an up-to-date data analysis using The Un Refugee Agency (UNHRC) data.
